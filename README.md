# 👋 Hello, World!

<p align="justify">
I'm a Software Developer based in São Carlos, Brazil, with professional experience since 2022, working across backend, full-stack, and distributed systems development. I specialize in Java (7–21), Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and RESTful APIs, with hands-on experience in microservices, event-driven architectures, and functional programming.  

Currently, I work on GIS-driven platforms for agricultural and environmental monitoring across Latin America, building scalable backend services and frontend applications using Java, Node.js, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL/PostGIS. I enjoy solving complex problems, collaborating in Agile teams, and delivering secure, reliable, and maintainable software.
